The CACHEDYN_STABILIZATION subsystem parameter specifies whether dynamic SQL statements can be captured for stabilization and whether Db2 uses the captured run time structures to process stabilized dynamic SQL statements that are not present in the dynamic statement cache. Db2 avoids processing full prepares when it uses the captured run time structures.
Db2 12 introduces this subsystem parameter. It takes effect only when the activated function level is function level 500 or higher.
