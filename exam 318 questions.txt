  SYSTEM is the highest priority (255) and is generally used for operating system address spaces.  SYSSTC runs at the next highest priority (254) and generally is used for highly important started tasks that are processing application work.  It may also be used for somewhat less important started tasks that are well behaved and consume relatively little CPU.  WLM automatically manages the priorities of the other services classes based on their goals and importance levels.
