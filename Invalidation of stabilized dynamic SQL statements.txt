Various actions and events can invalidate stabilized dynamic SQL statements.

For example, changing objects that are referenced by the statement, such by issuing ALTER, REVOKE, and DROP statements can invalidate stabilized dynamic SQL statements.

When these situations occur, Db2 marks the corresponding SYSDYNQRY row for the stabilized access path as invalid. 

The next time an invalidated statement is prepared, Db2 uses the full prepare process to generate new access paths. 

Invalidated statements are not stabilized until another START DYNQUERYCAPTURE command is issued to stabilize them again.

The VALID column of the SYSDYNQRY catalog table indicates the validity of stabilized dynamic statements. 

The COPYID=0 indicates the valid copy, and COPYID=4 indicates the invalidated copy.
